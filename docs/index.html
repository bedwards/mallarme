<p>Have you ever had unknown words singing on your lips — the cursed shreds of an absurd phrase?</p>
<p>I left my apartment with the clean sensation of a wing gliding across the strings of an instrument, dragging and light, which a voice replaced, pronouncing the words on a descending tone: "The Penultimate is dead," so that</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>The Penultimate</em></p>
<p class="fragment">ended the line and</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>Is dead</em></p>
<p>detached itself from the fateful suspension more uselessly still into the void of meaning. I took steps in the street and recognized in the sound <em>nul</em> the taut string of the musical instrument, which was forgotten and which the glorious Memory had certainly just visited with its wing or a palm, and, my finger on the artifice of the mystery, I smiled and implored with intellectual vows a different speculation. The phrase came back, virtual, released from an earlier fall of feather or branch, henceforth heard through the voice until at last it articulated itself alone, living with its own personality. I went along (no longer content with mere perception) reading it as an end of verse and, once, as a trial, adapting it to my speech; soon pronouncing it with a silence after "Penultimate," in which I found a painful pleasure: "The Penultimate —" then the string of the instrument, so taut in forgetfulness on the sound <em>nul</em>, broke no doubt, and I added by way of prayer: "Is dead." I did not stop trying to return to thoughts I preferred, alleging, to calm myself, that <em>penultimate</em> is surely a term from the lexicon meaning the next-to-last syllable of a word, and that its apparition, the rest badly abjured from a labor of linguistics by which daily there sobs the interruption of my noble poetic faculty: the sonority itself and the air of falsehood assumed by the haste of the easy affirmation were a cause of torment. Harassed, I resolved to let the words of this sad nature wander of themselves across my mouth, and I went murmuring with the intonation susceptible of condolence: "The Penultimate is dead, she is dead, quite dead, the despairing Penultimate," believing thereby to satisfy the anxiety, and not without the secret hope of burying it in the amplification of the psalmody when, horror! — by a magic easily deductible and nervous — I felt that I had, my hand reflected by a shopfront window, made the gesture of a caress that descends upon something, the voice itself (the first, which had indubitably been the only one).</p>
<p>But where the irrecusable intervention of the supernatural installs itself, and the beginning of the anguish under which my spirit — lately sovereign — agonizes, is when I saw, raising my eyes, in the street of the antique dealers, that I had instinctively followed and was standing before the shop of a luthier, seller of old instruments hung on the wall, and, on the ground, yellow palms and the wings, buried in shadow, of ancient birds. I fled, bizarre, a person condemned probably to wear the mourning of the inexplicable Penultimate.</p>

<p>A pale sky, over the world ending in decrepitude, is going perhaps to depart with the clouds: the tatters of the worn purple of sunsets bleed out in a river sleeping at the horizon, submerged in rays and water. The trees are bored; and, under their whitened foliage (from the dust of time rather than that of the roads), rises the canvas house of the Showman of things Past: many a streetlamp awaits the dusk and revives the faces of a wretched crowd, vanquished by the immortal sickness and the sin of centuries, of men beside their frail accomplices pregnant with the miserable fruits with which the earth will perish. In the anxious silence of all the eyes pleading over there where the sun, under the water, sinks with the despair of a cry, here is the simple pitch: "No sign regales you with the spectacle within, for there is not now a painter capable of giving even a sad shadow of it. I bring, alive (and preserved across the years by sovereign science) a Woman of the past. Some madness, original and naive, an ecstasy of gold, I know not what! named by her hair, folds with the grace of fabrics around a face illuminated by the bleeding nudity of her lips. In place of the futile garment, she has a body; and the eyes, like rare stones! are not worth that gaze which issues from her happy flesh: breasts raised firm as if full of an eternal milk, their tips toward the sky, and smooth legs that keep the salt of the first sea." Remembering their poor wives, bald, morbid and full of horror, the husbands press forward: they too, out of curiosity, melancholy, want to see.</p>
<p>When all have contemplated the noble creature, vestige of some epoch already accursed, some indifferent, for they will not have had the strength to understand, but others stricken and their eyelids moist with resigned tears, they will look at one another; while the poets of these times, feeling their extinguished eyes rekindle, will make their way toward their lamp, their brain drunk an instant with a confused glory, haunted by Rhythm and in the forgetting of existing in an epoch that has outlived beauty.</p>

<p>Since Maria left me to go to another star — which one, Orion, Altair; or you, green Venus? — I have always cherished solitude. How many long days I have spent alone with my cat. By <em>alone</em>, I mean without a material being, and my cat is a mystical companion, a spirit. I can therefore say that I have spent long days alone with my cat, and, alone, with one of the last authors of the Latin decadence; for since the white creature is no more, strangely and singularly I have loved everything that summed itself up in this word: fall. Thus, in the year, my favorite season is those last languid days of summer that immediately precede autumn, and in the day the hour when I take my walk is when the sun rests before vanishing, with rays of yellow copper on the grey walls and red copper on the windowpanes. Likewise the literature to which my spirit turns for a sad voluptuousness will be the dying poetry of the last moments of Rome, so long, however, as it in no way breathes the rejuvenating approach of the Barbarians and does not stammer the childish Latin of the first Christian proses.</p>
<p>I was reading, then, one of those dear poems (whose patches of rouge charm me more than the blush of youth) and plunging a hand into the fur of the pure animal, when a barrel organ sang languishing and melancholy beneath my window — it played in the great alley of poplars whose leaves seem yellow to me even in spring, since Maria passed that way with candles, one last time. The instrument of the sad, yes, truly: the piano sparkles, the violin opens the torn soul to the light, but the barrel organ, in the twilight of memory, made me desperately dream. Now that it murmured a cheerfully vulgar tune, one that put gaiety in the heart of the faubourgs, a dated tune, banal: how was it that its refrain sent me to dream and made me cry like a romantic ballad? I savored it slowly and I did not throw a sou from the window for fear of disturbing myself and perceiving that the instrument was not singing alone.</p>
