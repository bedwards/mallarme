<p>Have you ever had unknown words singing on your lips — the cursed shreds of an absurd phrase?</p>
<p>I left my apartment with the clean sensation of a wing gliding across the strings of an instrument, dragging and light, which a voice replaced, pronouncing the words on a descending tone: "The Penultimate is dead," so that</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>The Penultimate</em></p>
<p class="fragment">ended the line and</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>Is dead</em></p>
<p>detached itself from the fateful suspension more uselessly still into the void of meaning. I took steps in the street and recognized in the sound <em>nul</em> the taut string of the musical instrument, which was forgotten and which the glorious Memory had certainly just visited with its wing or a palm, and, my finger on the artifice of the mystery, I smiled and implored with intellectual vows a different speculation. The phrase came back, virtual, released from an earlier fall of feather or branch, henceforth heard through the voice until at last it articulated itself alone, living with its own personality. I went along (no longer content with mere perception) reading it as an end of verse and, once, as a trial, adapting it to my speech; soon pronouncing it with a silence after "Penultimate," in which I found a painful pleasure: "The Penultimate —" then the string of the instrument, so taut in forgetfulness on the sound <em>nul</em>, broke no doubt, and I added by way of prayer: "Is dead." I did not stop trying to return to thoughts I preferred, alleging, to calm myself, that <em>penultimate</em> is surely a term from the lexicon meaning the next-to-last syllable of a word, and that its apparition, the rest badly abjured from a labor of linguistics by which daily there sobs the interruption of my noble poetic faculty: the sonority itself and the air of falsehood assumed by the haste of the easy affirmation were a cause of torment. Harassed, I resolved to let the words of this sad nature wander of themselves across my mouth, and I went murmuring with the intonation susceptible of condolence: "The Penultimate is dead, she is dead, quite dead, the despairing Penultimate," believing thereby to satisfy the anxiety, and not without the secret hope of burying it in the amplification of the psalmody when, horror! — by a magic easily deductible and nervous — I felt that I had, my hand reflected by a shopfront window, made the gesture of a caress that descends upon something, the voice itself (the first, which had indubitably been the only one).</p>
<p>But where the irrecusable intervention of the supernatural installs itself, and the beginning of the anguish under which my spirit — lately sovereign — agonizes, is when I saw, raising my eyes, in the street of the antique dealers, that I had instinctively followed and was standing before the shop of a luthier, seller of old instruments hung on the wall, and, on the ground, yellow palms and the wings, buried in shadow, of ancient birds. I fled, bizarre, a person condemned probably to wear the mourning of the inexplicable Penultimate.</p>

<p>A pale sky, over the world ending in decrepitude, is going perhaps to depart with the clouds: the tatters of the worn purple of sunsets bleed out in a river sleeping at the horizon, submerged in rays and water. The trees are bored; and, under their whitened foliage (from the dust of time rather than that of the roads), rises the canvas house of the Showman of things Past: many a streetlamp awaits the dusk and revives the faces of a wretched crowd, vanquished by the immortal sickness and the sin of centuries, of men beside their frail accomplices pregnant with the miserable fruits with which the earth will perish. In the anxious silence of all the eyes pleading over there where the sun, under the water, sinks with the despair of a cry, here is the simple pitch: "No sign regales you with the spectacle within, for there is not now a painter capable of giving even a sad shadow of it. I bring, alive (and preserved across the years by sovereign science) a Woman of the past. Some madness, original and naive, an ecstasy of gold, I know not what! named by her hair, folds with the grace of fabrics around a face illuminated by the bleeding nudity of her lips. In place of the futile garment, she has a body; and the eyes, like rare stones! are not worth that gaze which issues from her happy flesh: breasts raised firm as if full of an eternal milk, their tips toward the sky, and smooth legs that keep the salt of the first sea." Remembering their poor wives, bald, morbid and full of horror, the husbands press forward: they too, out of curiosity, melancholy, want to see.</p>
<p>When all have contemplated the noble creature, vestige of some epoch already accursed, some indifferent, for they will not have had the strength to understand, but others stricken and their eyelids moist with resigned tears, they will look at one another; while the poets of these times, feeling their extinguished eyes rekindle, will make their way toward their lamp, their brain drunk an instant with a confused glory, haunted by Rhythm and in the forgetting of existing in an epoch that has outlived beauty.</p>

<p>Since Maria left me to go to another star — which one, Orion, Altair; or you, green Venus? — I have always cherished solitude. How many long days I have spent alone with my cat. By <em>alone</em>, I mean without a material being, and my cat is a mystical companion, a spirit. I can therefore say that I have spent long days alone with my cat, and, alone, with one of the last authors of the Latin decadence; for since the white creature is no more, strangely and singularly I have loved everything that summed itself up in this word: fall. Thus, in the year, my favorite season is those last languid days of summer that immediately precede autumn, and in the day the hour when I take my walk is when the sun rests before vanishing, with rays of yellow copper on the grey walls and red copper on the windowpanes. Likewise the literature to which my spirit turns for a sad voluptuousness will be the dying poetry of the last moments of Rome, so long, however, as it in no way breathes the rejuvenating approach of the Barbarians and does not stammer the childish Latin of the first Christian proses.</p>
<p>I was reading, then, one of those dear poems (whose patches of rouge charm me more than the blush of youth) and plunging a hand into the fur of the pure animal, when a barrel organ sang languishing and melancholy beneath my window — it played in the great alley of poplars whose leaves seem yellow to me even in spring, since Maria passed that way with candles, one last time. The instrument of the sad, yes, truly: the piano sparkles, the violin opens the torn soul to the light, but the barrel organ, in the twilight of memory, made me desperately dream. Now that it murmured a cheerfully vulgar tune, one that put gaiety in the heart of the faubourgs, a dated tune, banal: how was it that its refrain sent me to dream and made me cry like a romantic ballad? I savored it slowly and I did not throw a sou from the window for fear of disturbing myself and perceiving that the instrument was not singing alone.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I found my pipe while dreaming of a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Cigarettes thrown away with all the childish joys of summer in the past lit up by blue leaves of sun, the muslins, and my grave pipe taken up again by a serious man who wants to smoke at length without being disturbed, the better to work: but I was not expecting the surprise that this forsaken thing was preparing — scarcely had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I had to write, marveled, moved, I breathed the winter returning. I had not touched the faithful friend since my return to France, and all London, London as I lived it entirely for myself alone, appeared a year ago: first the dear fogs that muffle our brains and have, over there, a smell of their own, when they creep in under the window. My tobacco smelled of a dark room with leather furniture dusted with coal dust on which the thin black cat would roll; the great fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coal on the coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron basket, in the morning — when the postman struck the solemn double knock, which brought me back to life! I saw again through the window those sickly trees of the deserted square — I saw the open sea, so often crossed that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened with smoke — with my poor beloved wandering, in traveling clothes, a long dress the dull color of road dust, a coat that clung damp to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats without plume and almost without ribbons that rich ladies throw away on arriving, so tattered are they by the sea air, and that poor beloveds refurbish for many a season more. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief one waves when saying goodbye forever.</p>

<p>That Saxon clock, which runs slow and strikes thirteen among its flowers and its gods — whom has it belonged to? Think that it came from Saxony by the long stagecoaches, long ago.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Strange shadows hang from the worn windowpanes.)</p>
<p>And your Venetian mirror, deep as a cold fountain, in a shore of tarnished serpents — who has gazed into it? Ah! I am sure that more than one woman has bathed in that water the sin of her beauty; and perhaps I would see a naked phantom if I looked a long time.</p>
<p class="dialogue">— Villain, you often say wicked things..</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(I see spiderwebs at the top of the tall windows.)</p>
<p>Our chest is very old too: look how the fire reddens its sad wood; the faded curtains are as old as it is, and the tapestry of the armchairs stripped of color, and the old engravings on the walls, and all our old things? Does it not seem to you, even, that the finches and the blue bird have faded with time.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Do not think of the spiderwebs that tremble at the top of the tall windows.)</p>
<p>You love all this and that is why I can live near you. Have you not wished, my sister, with the gaze of long ago, that from one of my poems there appeared these words: "the grace of faded things"? New objects displease you; they frighten you too, with their brazen boldness, and you would feel the need to wear them out, — which is very hard for those who do not care for action.</p>
<p>Come, close your old German almanac, which you read so attentively, though it was published more than a hundred years ago and the kings it announces are all dead, and, on the old carpet lying down, your head resting among your charitable knees in your pale robe, O calm child, I will speak to you for hours; there are no more fields and the streets are empty, I will speak to you of our furniture.. You are distracted?</p>

<p>Poor pale child, why scream your shrill and insolent song at the top of your lungs in the street, where it is lost among the cats, lords of the rooftops? for it will not pass through the shutters of the first floors, behind which you do not know there hang heavy curtains of incarnadine silk.</p>
<p>Yet you sing fatally, with the tenacious assurance of a little man who goes off alone through life, counting on no one, working for himself. Have you never had a father? You haven't even an old woman to make you forget hunger by beating you, when you come home without a sou.</p>
<p>But you work for your keep: standing in the streets, covered in faded clothes cut for a grown man, a thinness premature and too great for your age, you sing to eat, fiercely, without lowering your mean eyes toward the other children playing on the pavement.</p>
<p>And your lament is so high, so high, that your bare head rising in the air as your voice climbs seems to want to leave your small shoulders.</p>
<p>Little man, who knows whether it will not go away one day, when, after having cried a long time in the cities, you will have committed a crime? a crime is not so hard; come, it is enough to have courage after the desire, and such as who.. Your little figure is energetic.</p>
<p>Not a sou falls into the wicker basket your long hand holds dangling without hope against your trousers: they will make you wicked and one day you will commit a crime.</p>
<p>Your head keeps straining upward and wants to leave you, as if it knew in advance, while you sing a tune that is becoming menacing.</p>
<p>It will bid you farewell when you pay for me, for those worth less than me. You probably came into the world for this and you have been fasting from the start; soon now, we will see you in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Oh! poor little head!</p>

<p>Orphan, I wandered in black, my eye vacant of family; at a crossroads the tents of a fair were unfolding — I sensed the future and that I would be thus, I loved the smell of vagabonds, toward them to forget my comrades. No chorus cry of tearing, nor long tirade, the drama requesting the holy hour of the footlights — I wished to speak with a kid too unsteady to figure among his race, in a nightcap cut like Dante's hood; who was withdrawing into himself, under the aspect of a slice of soft cheese, already the snow of summits, the lily or other constitutive whiteness of wings within: I would have begged him to admit me to his superior meal, shared quickly with some famous elder against a nearby canvas during feats of strength and banalities fit for daylight. Naked, pirouetting in his leotard nimbleness, to my surprise it was he who began the conversation: "Your parents?" — "I haven't any." — "Come now, if you only knew how funny it is, a father.. even last week when he refused his soup, he made faces just as beautiful as when the master was throwing slaps and kicks around. My dear!" and to triumph by raising his leg at me with glorious ease, "he wows us, papa," then to bite with chaste relish at the very young one's treat: "Your mama, you haven't got one either, maybe? you're alone? mine eats tow and the world claps hands. You don't know anything, parents are funny people who make you laugh." The parade was rising to a pitch, he left: I would sigh, me, disappointed suddenly at not having parents.</p>

<p>How far civilization is from procuring the pleasures attributable to this state! one must be astonished, for example, that an association between dreamers, residing there, does not exist in every great city, to subsidize a newspaper that would notice events in the light proper to dream. Artifice that <em>reality</em>, good for fixing the middling intellect among the mirages of a fact; but it rests for all that on some universal understanding: let us see then whether there is not, in the ideal, a necessary aspect, evident, simple, which serves as a type. I mean, with myself alone in view, to write as it struck my poet's gaze, this Anecdote, before the <em>reporters</em> divulge it to the crowd trained to assign to each thing its common character.</p>
<p>The little theater of PRODIGALITIES joined to its fairy-play <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> the exhibition of a living cousin of Atta Troll or of Martin; I had, recognizing the invitation of the complimentary ticket that had strayed to my house the day before, placed my hat in the vacant stall beside me, an absence of a friend testifying to the general taste for avoiding this naive spectacle. What was happening before me? nothing, except that: pale evasive muslin figures taking refuge on twenty pedestals in the architecture of Baghdad emerged, a smile and open arms, from the sad heaviness of the bear: while the hero, of those sylphs the evoker and their keeper, a clown, in his tall silver nudity, mocked the animal by our superiority. To enjoy as the crowd does the myth contained in all banality, what repose and, without neighbors where to pour out reflections, to see the ordinary and splendid vigil found at the footlights by my sated research of imaginations and symbols. A stranger to many a reminiscence of such evenings, the accident, the newest! aroused my attention: one of the numerous salvos of applause awarded according to the enthusiasm at the illustration on stage of the authentic privilege of Man, came, broken by what? to a clean stop, with a fixed crash of glory at its apogee, unable to spread. All ears, one had to be all eyes. At the gesture of the puppet, a palm clenched in the air opening its five fingers, I understood that he had, the ingenious one! captured the sympathies by the mime of catching on the wing some thing, figure (and this is all) of the ease by which everyone grasps an idea: and that moved by a light breeze, the bear rhythmically and gently raised was interrogating this exploit, one paw placed on the ribbons of the human shoulder. No one breathed, so much did this situation carry grave consequences for the honor of the race: what was going to happen? The other paw fell, supple, against an arm running along the leotard; and one saw, couple united in a secret rapprochement, like an inferior man, squat, good, standing on the spread of two hairy legs, straining to learn the practices of genius, and his black skull reaching only to the waist, the bust of his brilliant and supernatural brother: but who, him! raised up, the mouth mad with vagueness, a head of hair — an awful chief agitating by a visible thread in the horror the veritable denials of a fly of paper and gold. A clear spectacle, vaster than the trestles, with this gift, proper to the things of art, of lasting long: to perfect it I let, without being offended by the attitude probably fatal taken by the mime — depositary of our pride — tacitly spring forth, forbidden to the offspring of arctic regions, the discourse: "Be good (this was the sense), and rather than lack charity, explain to me the virtue of this atmosphere of splendor, of dust and of voice, where you taught me to move. My request, pressing, is just, for you do not seem, in an anguish that is not feigned; flung to the regions of wisdom, subtle elder! to me, to set you free, still clothed from the formless sojourn of the caverns where I plunged back, into the night of humble epochs, my latent force. Let us authenticate, by this tight embrace, before the multitude sitting to this end, the pact of our reconciliation." The absence of any breath joined to space, in whatever absolute place I was living, one of the dramas of astral history was choosing, to produce itself, this modest theater! The crowd was fading, entirely, into the emblem of its spiritual situation magnifying the scene: dispenser of modern ecstasy, alone, with the impartiality of an elementary thing, the gas, in the heights of the hall, continued a luminous noise of expectation.</p>
<p>The spell broke: it was when a piece of flesh, naked, brutal, crossed my vision directed from the interval of the scenery, in advance by a few instants on the reward, mysterious after these ordinary performances. A rag substituted bleeding beside the bear who, its instincts recovered earlier from a curiosity higher than the theatrical radiance it had been endowed with, fell back on all fours and, as though carrying away with it the Silence, went in the stifled tread of the species to sniff, in order to sink its teeth into it, this prey. A sigh, almost free of disappointment, relieved incomprehensibly the assembly: whose lorgnettes, by rows, searched, polishing their lenses, for the play of the splendid imbecile evaporated in his fear; but they saw a meal abject perhaps preferred by the animal — for it would first have had to make of it <em>our image</em>, in order to taste it. The curtain, hesitating until then as the danger or the emotion grew, suddenly brought down its newspaper of prices and commonplaces. I rose like everyone else, to go outside and breathe, astonished not to have felt, this time again, the same kind of impression as my fellows, but serene: for my way of seeing, after all, had been superior, and even the true one.</p>

<p>Springs push the organism to acts which, in another season, are unknown to it, and many a treatise of natural history abounds in descriptions of this phenomenon, in animals. It would be of a more plausible interest to gather certain of the alterations that the climatic instant brings to the bearing of individuals made for spirituality! Badly quit, by the irony of winter, I retain, as for myself, an equivocal state so long as an absolute or naive naturalism does not substitute itself there, capable of pursuing a pleasure in the differentiation of several blades of grass. Nothing in the present case bringing profit to the crowd, I escape, to meditate on it, under some shadows surrounding from yesterday the city: now it is their mystery, almost banal, that I shall exhibit as a striking and graspable example of spring inspirations.</p>
<p>Keen was my surprise, just then, in a little-frequented corner of the Bois de Boulogne, at my dark, low agitation when I saw, through the thousand interstices of shrubs good for concealing nothing, total and from the superior beatings of the tricorne animated down to the shoes fastened by silver buckles, an ecclesiastic, who apart from witnesses was responding to the solicitations of the grass. It did not please me (and nothing of the kind serves providential designs) that, guilty in equal measure of a falsely scandalized man seizing a pebble from the path, I should threaten with even my smile of intelligence a blush on the face of this poor man, hands covering it, other than the one no doubt found in his solitary exercise! Quick of foot, I had to, so as not to cause by my presence a distraction, use address; and strongly against the temptation of a backward glance, to figure in my mind the almost diabolical apparition that continued to rustle the renewal against its sides, to the right, to the left and of the belly, obtaining a chaste frenzy. Everything, to rub or fling the limbs, to roll, to slide, ended in a satisfaction: and to stop, forbidden the tickle of some tall flower stem on its black-stockinged calves, among this special robe worn with the appearance that one wears for oneself alone, one's wife. Solitude, cold silence sparse in the greenery, perceived by senses less subtle than those you disturb, you knew the furious snappings of a fabric; as if the night buried in its folds were at last shaken free! and the muffled collisions against the earth of the rejuvenated skeleton; but the madman had not you to contemplate. Hilarious, it was enough to seek in oneself the cause of a pleasure or perhaps of a duty, ill explained by a return, before a lawn, to the gambols of the seminary. The influence of the vernal breath gently dilating the immutable texts inscribed in his flesh, he too, emboldened by this agreeable trouble to his sterile thought, had come to acknowledge by a contact with Nature, immediate, clear, violent, positive, stripped of all intellectual curiosity, the general well-being; and candidly, far from obediences and the constraint of his occupation, the canons, the interdictions, the censures, he rolled, in the beatitude of his native simplicity, happier than a donkey. That the goal of his walk, be it straight and of one thrust, achieved not without shaking the pistils and wiping the saps attached to his person, the hero of my vision, to return, unperceived, into the crowd and the habits of his ministry, I do not dream of denying; but I have the right not to consider it. Has not my discretion toward debates first glimpsed been rewarded in fixing forever, like a passerby's reverie pleased to complete it, the image marked with the mysterious seal of modernity, at once baroque and beautiful?</p>

<p>Silence! it is certain that beside me, as in dreams, stretched out in the rocking of a drive under the wheels lulling the interjection of flowers, all woman, and I know one who sees clearly here, exempts me from the effort to utter a word: to compliment her aloft from some questioning toilette, offering of herself almost to the man in whose favor the afternoon is ending, unable against all this fortuitous rapprochement to suggest the distance on her features into a dimple of spiritual smile. So she does not consent to reality; for it was pitilessly, beyond the ray one felt expiring with luxury on the varnish of the landau, like a vociferation, among too much tacit felicity at a fall of day on the suburbs, with storm, in all directions at once and without motive, from the strident laugh ordinary to things and their triumphant brasswork: in fact, the cacophony to anyone's hearing, an instant set aside, rather than being absorbed, near its own idea, remains raw before the obsession of existence.</p>
<p>"The fair at.." and I know not what suburban rendezvous! the child named into my distractions, a clear voice free of any boredom; I obeyed and stopped.</p>
<p>Without compensation for this jolt other than a need for figurative explanation plausible to my spirits, as symmetrically glasses lit dimly with garlands and attributes arrange themselves, I decided, the solitude missed, to plunge myself even with bravery into this unchaining, expressly and hatefully, of all I had lately fled in gracious company: ready and showing no surprise at the modification in our program, with her ingenuous arm she rests on me, while we walk on through the row, the avenue of bewilderment which divides in echo the same uproar of fairs and lets the crowd shut the universe in there for a time. Subsequently, to the assaults of a mediocre debauchery aimed at diverting our stagnation amused by the twilight from anything whatsoever, at the back, bizarre and crimson, we were held as by the naked incendiary to a human spectacle, poignant: disowned by the painted frame or the inscription in capitals, a booth, apparently empty.</p>
<p>To whom this ragged mattress for improvising here, as veils in all times and temples, the arcane! its frequentation during fasting had not excited in its possessor before he unrolled it the gonfalon of despairs into rejoicing, the hallucination of a marvel to show (how the inanity of its famished nightmare); and yet, moved by the fairground character of exception to the daily misery that a meadow, when the mysterious word <em>fête</em> institutes it, holds shoes numerous there trampling (by reason of this, in the depths of clothing some unique velleity of the hard sou to come out for the sole purpose of spending itself), he too! anyone who stripped of everything except the notion that there was cause to be one of the elect, if not to sell, to show — but what — had yielded to the convocation of the beneficent rendezvous. Or, very prosaically, perhaps the rat less educated than himself, this beggar counting on the athletic vigor of his muscles, to decide the popular craze, was at this precise instant failing, as often results from the challenge of man by general circumstances.</p>
<p>"Beat the drum!" proposed in highness Madame.. you alone know Who, marking an antiquated drum she was uncrossing her arms to raise so as to signify the useless approach of a theater without prestige — an old man, that this camaraderie with an instrument of rumor and of calling perhaps seduced to his vacant design; then, as if all at once one could here envision the most beautiful thing, the enigma, by a jewel closing the society woman, insofar as at her throat the absence of reply, glittered! here she is engulfed, to my clown's surprise speechless before a halt of the public palmed off with the awakening of drums and of flags deafening my invariable and obscure thing — to myself first of all — "Come in, everyone, it is only a sou, refunded to whoever is not satisfied with the show." The nimbus into a doormat in the thanks joining two senile palms emptied, I waved the colors, as a signal, from afar, and donned my hat, ready to part the standing crowd in the secret of what it had been able to make of this place without dream — by the initiative of a contemporary of our evenings.</p>
<p>At knee height, she was emerging, on a table, from the hundred heads.</p>
<p>Clean as a jet straying from elsewhere was electrically darting — flashes for me this calculation that, failing anything else, she, according to fashion, a fantasy or the humor of the sky, was gracing with her beauty, without supplement of dance or song, for the mob to amply pay the alms exacted in favor of anything whatsoever; and by the same stroke I understand my duty in the peril of the subtle exhibition, or that there was nothing in the world to ward off the defection of curiosities but to resort to some absolute power, like a Metaphor. Quick, to disgorge to the point of clarification, on many a physiognomy, their security which, grasping all at once, surrenders to the evidence, even if arduous, implied in the word and consents to exchange its token against exact and superior presumptions — in short, the certainty for each of not being cheated.</p>
<p>A last glance, at a head of hair where smokes then lights up with garden splendors the paling of the hat in crêpe of the same tone as the statuesque robe rising, she advances on the spectator, on one foot — like the rest — hortensia.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="line">The hair flight of a flame to the extreme</span>
<span class="line">Occident of desires to deploy it all</span>
<span class="line">Settles (I would say dies a diadem)</span>
<span class="line">Toward the crowned brow its ancient hearth</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="line">But without gold to sigh that this living bare</span>
<span class="line">Ignition of the always interior fire</span>
<span class="line">Originally the sole one continues</span>
<span class="line">In the jewel of the eye truthful or laughing</span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="line">A nudity of tender hero defames</span>
<span class="line">Her who moving neither star nor fires at the finger</span>
<span class="line">Nothing but to simplify with glory the woman.</span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="line">Accomplishes by its dazzling head the exploit,</span>
<span class="line">Of sowing rubies the doubt that she flays</span>
<span class="line">As a joyous and tutelary torch</span>
</div>
<p>My aid matched the living allegory's size as she already resigned her faction, perhaps wanting for eloquence from me to lull the impulse gently down: "I shall make you observe," I added, now squarely in step with the understanding of the visitors, cutting short their bewilderment before this leave-taking by an affectation of returning to the authenticity of the spectacle — "Ladies and Gentlemen, that the person who has had the honor of submitting to your judgment requires, to communicate to you the meaning of her charm, no costume nor any usual accessory of the theater. This naturalness accommodates itself perfectly because fashion always furnishes the toilette with one of the primordial motifs of woman, and suffices, as your sympathetic approbation convinces me." A suspense of appreciative mark save a few confounding "Of course!" or "That's it!" and "Yes" from throats like several bravos lent by generous pairs of hands, led to the exit into a vacancy of trees and night, the crowd where we were going to mingle — had it not been for the expectation in white gloves still of an infantile young sailor whom they dreamed of limbering up for the assessment of a haughty garter.</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "Thank you" consented the dear one, a puff straight at her of a constellation or of leaves drunk as if to find in it if not the reassurance, at least the frigid habit of her voice</p>
<p>"I have in my mind the memory of things that are not forgotten."</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "Oh! nothing but the commonplace of an aesthetics.."</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "That you might not have introduced perhaps, who knows? my friend, the pretext to formulate thus before me in the conjugal isolation of, say, our carriage — where is it — let us find it again: — but this sprang out, forced, under the brutal blow to the stomach, that causes an impatience of people to whom cost what it may and sudden it is necessary to proclaim something — were it only the reverie.."</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "Who does not know herself and launches naked in fear, across the public; that is true. As you, Madame, would not have heard it so irrefutably, despite its reduplication on a rhyme of the final stroke, my pitch after a primitive mode of the sonnet, I wager, if each term were not echoed back to you by various eardrums, to charm a mind open to multiple comprehension."</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "Perhaps!" accepted our thought into an enjoyment of the same nocturnal breath.</p>

<p>I had been rowing for a long time, with a clean sweeping gesture, drowsy, my eyes fixed inward on the complete forgetting of going, as the laughter of the hour flowed round about. So much immobility lazed that grazed by an inert sound where the yawl slipped to half its length, I did not verify the stop until the steady glinting of initials on the bared oars recalled me to my worldly identity.</p>
<p>What was happening, where was I?</p>
<p>I had, to see clearly into the adventure, to recall my departure early, that July of flame, on the lively interval between its sleeping vegetations of an always narrow and distracted stream, in quest of water-blossomings and with the design of recognizing the site occupied by the property of a friend's friend, to whom I was to improvise a greeting. Without any ribbon of grass detaining me before one landscape more than another, chased with its reflection in the water by the same impartial stroke of oar, I had just run aground in some tuft of reeds, mysterious end of my course, in the middle of the river: where at once widened into a fluvial grove, it spreads a nonchalant pond pleated with hesitations from a source.</p>
<p>The detailed inspection taught me that this obstacle of greenery tapering into the current masked the single arch of a bridge, prolonged to land, here and there, by a hedge enclosing lawns. I understood. Simply the park of Madame.., the unknown to be greeted.</p>
<p>A fine vicinity, during the season, the nature of the person who had chosen a retreat as humid and impenetrable could only be conformable to my taste. Sure of it, she had made of this crystal her interior mirror, sheltered from the indiscretion glaring in the afternoons; she came there and the silver mist icing the willows was soon nothing but the limpidity of her gaze accustomed to each leaf.</p>
<p>Entirely I evoked her lustral.</p>
<p>Bent in the sporting attitude that kept me in curiosity, as under the spacious silence of what was announcing itself the stranger, I smiled at the beginning of servitude released by a feminine possibility: that the straps attaching the rower's shoe to the boat's planking were not without meaning, as one does not become one with the instrument of one's sorcery.</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "Just as well then, any woman at all.." I was about to finish.</p>
<p>When an imperceptible sound made me wonder whether the inhabitant of the bank was haunting my leisure, or unexpectedly the pool.</p>
<p>The step ceased, why?</p>
<p>Subtle secret of feet that come, that go, leading the spirit where the dear shadow wills — buried in cambric and the lace of a skirt flooding the ground as if to circumvent from heel to toe, in a flotation, that initiative by which the walk opens, all the way down, and the folds cast back into a train, an escape, of its knowing double arrow.</p>
<p>Does the stroller herself know a reason for her station: and is it not, for me, too tender to raise my head above these rushes and all the mental drowsiness where my lucidity veils itself, to question the mystery as far as that!</p>
<p class="dialogue">— "To what type your features conform themselves, I sense their precision, Madame, interrupted here by the rustling of an arrival, yes! this instinctive charm from below that does not defend against the most authentically tied explorer, with a diamond buckle, belts. So vague a concept suffices; and does not transgress the delight stamped with generality that permits and commands the exclusion of all faces, to the point that the revelation of one (do not lean to peer, confirmed, on the furtive threshold where I reign) would chase away my trouble, with which it has nothing to do."</p>
<p>My presentation, in this garb of aquatic marauder, I can risk it, with the excuse of chance.</p>
<p>Separated, we are together: I slip into her confused intimacy, in this suspense on the water where my reverie delays the indecisive one, better than a visit, followed by others, will authorize. How many idle speeches in comparison with the one I held in order not to be heard, it will be necessary, before finding once more as intuitive an accord as now, the hearing level with the mahogany toward the sand entire that has fallen silent!</p>
<p>The pause measures itself to the time of her determination.</p>
<p>Advise, O my dream, what to do.</p>
<p>To sum up in a glance the virgin absence scattered in this solitude and, as one gathers, in memory of a site, one of those magical water lilies enclosed there that suddenly surface, enveloping in their hollow whiteness a nothing, made of intact dreams, of the happiness that will not take place and of my breath held here in the fear of an apparition, to leave with: tacitly, unmooring little by little, without the collision breaking the illusion nor the lapping of the visible bubble of foam curled at my flight casting at the feet of anyone the transparent resemblance of the theft of my ideal flower.</p>
<p>If, attracted by a feeling of the unusual, she has appeared, the Meditative or the Haughty, the Fierce, the Gay — too bad for that unspeakable expression I shall never know! for I accomplished according to the rules the maneuver: freeing myself, I turned and was already rounding a bend in the stream, carrying away like a noble swan's egg, such that no flight will spring from it, my imaginary trophy, which swells with nothing other than the exquisite vacancy of self that one loves, in summer, to pursue, in the alleys of her park, every lady, pausing sometimes and at length, as at the brink of a spring or some body of water.</p>

<p>"Glory! I knew it only yesterday, irrefragable, and nothing will interest me in being called thus by anyone.</p>
<p>"A hundred posters assimilating the misunderstood gold of days, treason of the letter, have fled, as to the very confines of the city, my eyes level with the horizon dragged along the rail by a departure before gathering themselves into the abstruse pride that the approach of a forest gives in its season of apotheosis.</p>
<p>"So much discord in the exaltation of the hour, a cry falsified this name known for deploying the continuity of treetops late vanished, Fontainebleau, that I thought, the glass of the compartment violated, to throttle the interrupter by the fist as well as by the throat: Be quiet! Do not divulge by the fact of an indifferent bark the shadow here insinuated in my spirit, at the doors of wagons beating under an inspired and egalitarian wind, the omnipresent tourists vomited. A deceitful quietude of rich woods suspends all around some extraordinary state of illusion, what do you answer me? that they have, these travelers, for your station today left the capital, good vociferous employee through duty and of whom I expect, far from cornering an intoxication shared by all departure through the liberalities conjoined of Nature and of the State, nothing but a silence prolonged the time to isolate myself from the urban delegation toward the ecstatic torpor of those leaves down there too long immobilized lest a crisis soon scatter them into the air; here, without affront to your integrity, take, a coin.</p>
<p>"An inattentive uniform inviting me toward some barrier, I hand over without a word, in place of the suborning metal, my ticket.</p>
<p>"Obeyed though, yes, only to see the asphalt spread cleanly with no footsteps, for I cannot still imagine that in this pompous and exceptional October! of the million existences staging their emptiness insofar as a monotony enormous as a capital is about to efface itself here at the hiss of a whistle under the fog, not one furtively escaped that has not felt what it is, this year, of bitter and luminous sobs, many an indecisive flotation of idea deserting the chances like branches, that shiver and what makes one think of an autumn under the skies.</p>
<p>"No one and, arms of doubt flung wide as who also carries a lot of secret splendor, too inappreciable a trophy to appear! but without immediately dashing into this diurnal vigil of immortal trunks at the pouring out upon one of superhuman prides (for must not one verify the authenticity?) nor crossing the threshold where torches are consumed, in a high guard, all anterior dreams reverberating in purple their brilliance in the bare universal sacring of the royal intruder who will have had but to come: I waited, to exist, that slow and taken again by the ordinary movement, it should reduce to the proportions of a puerile chimera carrying away from the world some part, the train that had deposited me there alone."</p>
