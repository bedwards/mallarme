<p>Have you ever had unknown words singing on your lips — the cursed shreds of an absurd phrase?</p>
<p>I left my apartment with the clean sensation of a wing gliding across the strings of an instrument, dragging and light, which a voice replaced, pronouncing the words on a descending tone: "The Penultimate is dead," so that</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>The Penultimate</em></p>
<p class="fragment">ended the line and</p>
<p class="italic-block"><em>Is dead</em></p>
<p>detached itself from the fateful suspension more uselessly still into the void of meaning. I took steps in the street and recognized in the sound <em>nul</em> the taut string of the musical instrument, which was forgotten and which the glorious Memory had certainly just visited with its wing or a palm, and, my finger on the artifice of the mystery, I smiled and implored with intellectual vows a different speculation. The phrase came back, virtual, released from an earlier fall of feather or branch, henceforth heard through the voice until at last it articulated itself alone, living with its own personality. I went along (no longer content with mere perception) reading it as an end of verse and, once, as a trial, adapting it to my speech; soon pronouncing it with a silence after "Penultimate," in which I found a painful pleasure: "The Penultimate —" then the string of the instrument, so taut in forgetfulness on the sound <em>nul</em>, broke no doubt, and I added by way of prayer: "Is dead." I did not stop trying to return to thoughts I preferred, alleging, to calm myself, that <em>penultimate</em> is surely a term from the lexicon meaning the next-to-last syllable of a word, and that its apparition, the rest badly abjured from a labor of linguistics by which daily there sobs the interruption of my noble poetic faculty: the sonority itself and the air of falsehood assumed by the haste of the easy affirmation were a cause of torment. Harassed, I resolved to let the words of this sad nature wander of themselves across my mouth, and I went murmuring with the intonation susceptible of condolence: "The Penultimate is dead, she is dead, quite dead, the despairing Penultimate," believing thereby to satisfy the anxiety, and not without the secret hope of burying it in the amplification of the psalmody when, horror! — by a magic easily deductible and nervous — I felt that I had, my hand reflected by a shopfront window, made the gesture of a caress that descends upon something, the voice itself (the first, which had indubitably been the only one).</p>
<p>But where the irrecusable intervention of the supernatural installs itself, and the beginning of the anguish under which my spirit — lately sovereign — agonizes, is when I saw, raising my eyes, in the street of the antique dealers, that I had instinctively followed and was standing before the shop of a luthier, seller of old instruments hung on the wall, and, on the ground, yellow palms and the wings, buried in shadow, of ancient birds. I fled, bizarre, a person condemned probably to wear the mourning of the inexplicable Penultimate.</p>

<p>A pale sky, over the world ending in decrepitude, is going perhaps to depart with the clouds: the tatters of the worn purple of sunsets bleed out in a river sleeping at the horizon, submerged in rays and water. The trees are bored; and, under their whitened foliage (from the dust of time rather than that of the roads), rises the canvas house of the Showman of things Past: many a streetlamp awaits the dusk and revives the faces of a wretched crowd, vanquished by the immortal sickness and the sin of centuries, of men beside their frail accomplices pregnant with the miserable fruits with which the earth will perish. In the anxious silence of all the eyes pleading over there where the sun, under the water, sinks with the despair of a cry, here is the simple pitch: "No sign regales you with the spectacle within, for there is not now a painter capable of giving even a sad shadow of it. I bring, alive (and preserved across the years by sovereign science) a Woman of the past. Some madness, original and naive, an ecstasy of gold, I know not what! named by her hair, folds with the grace of fabrics around a face illuminated by the bleeding nudity of her lips. In place of the futile garment, she has a body; and the eyes, like rare stones! are not worth that gaze which issues from her happy flesh: breasts raised firm as if full of an eternal milk, their tips toward the sky, and smooth legs that keep the salt of the first sea." Remembering their poor wives, bald, morbid and full of horror, the husbands press forward: they too, out of curiosity, melancholy, want to see.</p>
<p>When all have contemplated the noble creature, vestige of some epoch already accursed, some indifferent, for they will not have had the strength to understand, but others stricken and their eyelids moist with resigned tears, they will look at one another; while the poets of these times, feeling their extinguished eyes rekindle, will make their way toward their lamp, their brain drunk an instant with a confused glory, haunted by Rhythm and in the forgetting of existing in an epoch that has outlived beauty.</p>

<p>Since Maria left me to go to another star — which one, Orion, Altair; or you, green Venus? — I have always cherished solitude. How many long days I have spent alone with my cat. By <em>alone</em>, I mean without a material being, and my cat is a mystical companion, a spirit. I can therefore say that I have spent long days alone with my cat, and, alone, with one of the last authors of the Latin decadence; for since the white creature is no more, strangely and singularly I have loved everything that summed itself up in this word: fall. Thus, in the year, my favorite season is those last languid days of summer that immediately precede autumn, and in the day the hour when I take my walk is when the sun rests before vanishing, with rays of yellow copper on the grey walls and red copper on the windowpanes. Likewise the literature to which my spirit turns for a sad voluptuousness will be the dying poetry of the last moments of Rome, so long, however, as it in no way breathes the rejuvenating approach of the Barbarians and does not stammer the childish Latin of the first Christian proses.</p>
<p>I was reading, then, one of those dear poems (whose patches of rouge charm me more than the blush of youth) and plunging a hand into the fur of the pure animal, when a barrel organ sang languishing and melancholy beneath my window — it played in the great alley of poplars whose leaves seem yellow to me even in spring, since Maria passed that way with candles, one last time. The instrument of the sad, yes, truly: the piano sparkles, the violin opens the torn soul to the light, but the barrel organ, in the twilight of memory, made me desperately dream. Now that it murmured a cheerfully vulgar tune, one that put gaiety in the heart of the faubourgs, a dated tune, banal: how was it that its refrain sent me to dream and made me cry like a romantic ballad? I savored it slowly and I did not throw a sou from the window for fear of disturbing myself and perceiving that the instrument was not singing alone.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I found my pipe while dreaming of a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Cigarettes thrown away with all the childish joys of summer in the past lit up by blue leaves of sun, the muslins, and my grave pipe taken up again by a serious man who wants to smoke at length without being disturbed, the better to work: but I was not expecting the surprise that this forsaken thing was preparing — scarcely had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I had to write, marveled, moved, I breathed the winter returning. I had not touched the faithful friend since my return to France, and all London, London as I lived it entirely for myself alone, appeared a year ago: first the dear fogs that muffle our brains and have, over there, a smell of their own, when they creep in under the window. My tobacco smelled of a dark room with leather furniture dusted with coal dust on which the thin black cat would roll; the great fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coal on the coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron basket, in the morning — when the postman struck the solemn double knock, which brought me back to life! I saw again through the window those sickly trees of the deserted square — I saw the open sea, so often crossed that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened with smoke — with my poor beloved wandering, in traveling clothes, a long dress the dull color of road dust, a coat that clung damp to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats without plume and almost without ribbons that rich ladies throw away on arriving, so tattered are they by the sea air, and that poor beloveds refurbish for many a season more. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief one waves when saying goodbye forever.</p>

<p>That Saxon clock, which runs slow and strikes thirteen among its flowers and its gods — whom has it belonged to? Think that it came from Saxony by the long stagecoaches, long ago.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Strange shadows hang from the worn windowpanes.)</p>
<p>And your Venetian mirror, deep as a cold fountain, in a shore of tarnished serpents — who has gazed into it? Ah! I am sure that more than one woman has bathed in that water the sin of her beauty; and perhaps I would see a naked phantom if I looked a long time.</p>
<p class="dialogue">— Villain, you often say wicked things..</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(I see spiderwebs at the top of the tall windows.)</p>
<p>Our chest is very old too: look how the fire reddens its sad wood; the faded curtains are as old as it is, and the tapestry of the armchairs stripped of color, and the old engravings on the walls, and all our old things? Does it not seem to you, even, that the finches and the blue bird have faded with time.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Do not think of the spiderwebs that tremble at the top of the tall windows.)</p>
<p>You love all this and that is why I can live near you. Have you not wished, my sister, with the gaze of long ago, that from one of my poems there appeared these words: "the grace of faded things"? New objects displease you; they frighten you too, with their brazen boldness, and you would feel the need to wear them out, — which is very hard for those who do not care for action.</p>
<p>Come, close your old German almanac, which you read so attentively, though it was published more than a hundred years ago and the kings it announces are all dead, and, on the old carpet lying down, your head resting among your charitable knees in your pale robe, O calm child, I will speak to you for hours; there are no more fields and the streets are empty, I will speak to you of our furniture.. You are distracted?</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(Those spiderwebs shiver at the top of the tall windows.)</p>

<p>Poor pale child, why scream your shrill and insolent song at the top of your lungs in the street, where it is lost among the cats, lords of the rooftops? for it will not pass through the shutters of the first floors, behind which you do not know there hang heavy curtains of incarnadine silk.</p>
<p>Yet you sing fatally, with the tenacious assurance of a little man who goes off alone through life, counting on no one, working for himself. Have you never had a father? You haven't even an old woman to make you forget hunger by beating you, when you come home without a sou.</p>
<p>But you work for your keep: standing in the streets, covered in faded clothes cut for a grown man, a thinness premature and too great for your age, you sing to eat, fiercely, without lowering your mean eyes toward the other children playing on the pavement.</p>
<p>And your lament is so high, so high, that your bare head rising in the air as your voice climbs seems to want to leave your small shoulders.</p>
<p>Little man, who knows whether it will not go away one day, when, after having cried a long time in the cities, you will have committed a crime? a crime is not so hard; come, it is enough to have courage after the desire, and such as who.. Your little figure is energetic.</p>
<p>Not a sou falls into the wicker basket your long hand holds dangling without hope against your trousers: they will make you wicked and one day you will commit a crime.</p>
<p>Your head keeps straining upward and wants to leave you, as if it knew in advance, while you sing a tune that is becoming menacing.</p>
<p>It will bid you farewell when you pay for me, for those worth less than me. You probably came into the world for this and you have been fasting from the start; soon now, we will see you in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Oh! poor little head!</p>

<p>Orphan, I wandered in black, my eye vacant of family; at a crossroads the tents of a fair were unfolding — I sensed the future and that I would be thus, I loved the smell of vagabonds, toward them to forget my comrades. No chorus cry of tearing, nor long tirade, the drama requesting the holy hour of the footlights — I wished to speak with a kid too unsteady to figure among his race, in a nightcap cut like Dante's hood; who was withdrawing into himself, under the aspect of a slice of soft cheese, already the snow of summits, the lily or other constitutive whiteness of wings within: I would have begged him to admit me to his superior meal, shared quickly with some famous elder against a nearby canvas during feats of strength and banalities fit for daylight. Naked, pirouetting in his leotard nimbleness, to my surprise it was he who began the conversation: "Your parents?" — "I haven't any." — "Come now, if you only knew how funny it is, a father.. even last week when he refused his soup, he made faces just as beautiful as when the master was throwing slaps and kicks around. My dear!" and to triumph by raising his leg at me with glorious ease, "he wows us, papa," then to bite with chaste relish at the very young one's treat: "Your mama, you haven't got one either, maybe? you're alone? mine eats tow and the world claps hands. You don't know anything, parents are funny people who make you laugh." The parade was rising to a pitch, he left: I would sigh, me, disappointed suddenly at not having parents.</p>
