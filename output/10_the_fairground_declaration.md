# The Fairground Declaration

Silence! it is certain that beside me, as in dreams, stretched out in the rocking of a drive under the wheels lulling the interjection of flowers, all woman, and I know one who sees clearly here, exempts me from the effort to utter a word: to compliment her aloft from some questioning toilette, offering of herself almost to the man in whose favor the afternoon is ending, unable against all this fortuitous rapprochement to suggest the distance on her features into a dimple of spiritual smile. So she does not consent to reality; for it was pitilessly, beyond the ray one felt expiring with luxury on the varnish of the landau, like a vociferation, among too much tacit felicity at a fall of day on the suburbs, with storm, in all directions at once and without motive, from the strident laugh ordinary to things and their triumphant brasswork: in fact, the cacophony to anyone's hearing, an instant set aside, rather than being absorbed, near its own idea, remains raw before the obsession of existence.

"The fair at.." and I know not what suburban rendezvous! the child named into my distractions, a clear voice free of any boredom; I obeyed and stopped.

Without compensation for this jolt other than a need for figurative explanation plausible to my spirits, as symmetrically glasses lit dimly with garlands and attributes arrange themselves, I decided, the solitude missed, to plunge myself even with bravery into this unchaining, expressly and hatefully, of all I had lately fled in gracious company: ready and showing no surprise at the modification in our program, with her ingenuous arm she rests on me, while we walk on through the row, the avenue of bewilderment which divides in echo the same uproar of fairs and lets the crowd shut the universe in there for a time. Subsequently, to the assaults of a mediocre debauchery aimed at diverting our stagnation amused by the twilight from anything whatsoever, at the back, bizarre and crimson, we were held as by the naked incendiary to a human spectacle, poignant: disowned by the painted frame or the inscription in capitals, a booth, apparently empty.

To whom this ragged mattress for improvising here, as veils in all times and temples, the arcane! its frequentation during fasting had not excited in its possessor before he unrolled it the gonfalon of despairs into rejoicing, the hallucination of a marvel to show (how the inanity of its famished nightmare); and yet, moved by the fairground character of exception to the daily misery that a meadow, when the mysterious word *fête* institutes it, holds shoes numerous there trampling (by reason of this, in the depths of clothing some unique velleity of the hard sou to come out for the sole purpose of spending itself), he too! anyone who stripped of everything except the notion that there was cause to be one of the elect, if not to sell, to show — but what — had yielded to the convocation of the beneficent rendezvous. Or, very prosaically, perhaps the rat less educated than himself, this beggar counting on the athletic vigor of his muscles, to decide the popular craze, was at this precise instant failing, as often results from the challenge of man by general circumstances.

"Beat the drum!" proposed in highness Madame.. you alone know Who, marking an antiquated drum she was uncrossing her arms to raise so as to signify the useless approach of a theater without prestige — an old man, that this camaraderie with an instrument of rumor and of calling perhaps seduced to his vacant design; then, as if all at once one could here envision the most beautiful thing, the enigma, by a jewel closing the society woman, insofar as at her throat the absence of reply, glittered! here she is engulfed, to my clown's surprise speechless before a halt of the public palmed off with the awakening of drums and of flags deafening my invariable and obscure thing — to myself first of all — "Come in, everyone, it is only a sou, refunded to whoever is not satisfied with the show." The nimbus into a doormat in the thanks joining two senile palms emptied, I waved the colors, as a signal, from afar, and donned my hat, ready to part the standing crowd in the secret of what it had been able to make of this place without dream — by the initiative of a contemporary of our evenings.

At knee height, she was emerging, on a table, from the hundred heads.

Clean as a jet straying from elsewhere was electrically darting — flashes for me this calculation that, failing anything else, she, according to fashion, a fantasy or the humor of the sky, was gracing with her beauty, without supplement of dance or song, for the mob to amply pay the alms exacted in favor of anything whatsoever; and by the same stroke I understand my duty in the peril of the subtle exhibition, or that there was nothing in the world to ward off the defection of curiosities but to resort to some absolute power, like a Metaphor. Quick, to disgorge to the point of clarification, on many a physiognomy, their security which, grasping all at once, surrenders to the evidence, even if arduous, implied in the word and consents to exchange its token against exact and superior presumptions — in short, the certainty for each of not being cheated.

A last glance, at a head of hair where smokes then lights up with garden splendors the paling of the hat in crêpe of the same tone as the statuesque robe rising, she advances on the spectator, on one foot — like the rest — hortensia.

Then:

<span class="line">The hair flight of a flame to the extreme</span>
<span class="line">Occident of desires to deploy it all</span>
<span class="line">Settles (I would say dies a diadem)</span>
<span class="line">Toward the crowned brow its ancient hearth</span>

<span class="line">But without gold to sigh that this living bare</span>
<span class="line">Ignition of the always interior fire</span>
<span class="line">Originally the sole one continues</span>
<span class="line">In the jewel of the eye truthful or laughing</span>

<span class="line">A nudity of tender hero defames</span>
<span class="line">Her who moving neither star nor fires at the finger</span>
<span class="line">Nothing but to simplify with glory the woman.</span>

<span class="line">Accomplishes by its dazzling head the exploit,</span>
<span class="line">Of sowing rubies the doubt that she flays</span>
<span class="line">As a joyous and tutelary torch</span>

My aid matched the living allegory's size as she already resigned her faction, perhaps wanting for eloquence from me to lull the impulse gently down: "I shall make you observe," I added, now squarely in step with the understanding of the visitors, cutting short their bewilderment before this leave-taking by an affectation of returning to the authenticity of the spectacle — "Ladies and Gentlemen, that the person who has had the honor of submitting to your judgment requires, to communicate to you the meaning of her charm, no costume nor any usual accessory of the theater. This naturalness accommodates itself perfectly because fashion always furnishes the toilette with one of the primordial motifs of woman, and suffices, as your sympathetic approbation convinces me." A suspense of appreciative mark save a few confounding "Of course!" or "That's it!" and "Yes" from throats like several bravos lent by generous pairs of hands, led to the exit into a vacancy of trees and night, the crowd where we were going to mingle — had it not been for the expectation in white gloves still of an infantile young sailor whom they dreamed of limbering up for the assessment of a haughty garter.

— "Thank you" consented the dear one, a puff straight at her of a constellation or of leaves drunk as if to find in it if not the reassurance, at least the frigid habit of her voice

"I have in my mind the memory of things that are not forgotten."

— "Oh! nothing but the commonplace of an aesthetics.."

— "That you might not have introduced perhaps, who knows? my friend, the pretext to formulate thus before me in the conjugal isolation of, say, our carriage — where is it — let us find it again: — but this sprang out, forced, under the brutal blow to the stomach, that causes an impatience of people to whom cost what it may and sudden it is necessary to proclaim something — were it only the reverie.."

— "Who does not know herself and launches naked in fear, across the public; that is true. As you, Madame, would not have heard it so irrefutably, despite its reduplication on a rhyme of the final stroke, my pitch after a primitive mode of the sonnet, I wager, if each term were not echoed back to you by various eardrums, to charm a mind open to multiple comprehension."

— "Perhaps!" accepted our thought into an enjoyment of the same nocturnal breath.
