# Winter Shiver

That Saxon clock, which runs slow and strikes thirteen among its flowers and its gods — whom has it belonged to? Think that it came from Saxony by the long stagecoaches, long ago.

(Strange shadows hang from the worn windowpanes.)

And your Venetian mirror, deep as a cold fountain, in a shore of tarnished serpents — who has gazed into it? Ah! I am sure that more than one woman has bathed in that water the sin of her beauty; and perhaps I would see a naked phantom if I looked a long time.

— Villain, you often say wicked things..

(I see spiderwebs at the top of the tall windows.)

Our chest is very old too: look how the fire reddens its sad wood; the faded curtains are as old as it is, and the tapestry of the armchairs stripped of color, and the old engravings on the walls, and all our old things? Does it not seem to you, even, that the finches and the blue bird have faded with time.

(Do not think of the spiderwebs that tremble at the top of the tall windows.)

You love all this and that is why I can live near you. Have you not wished, my sister, with the gaze of long ago, that from one of my poems there appeared these words: "the grace of faded things"? New objects displease you; they frighten you too, with their brazen boldness, and you would feel the need to wear them out, — which is very hard for those who do not care for action.

Come, close your old German almanac, which you read so attentively, though it was published more than a hundred years ago and the kings it announces are all dead, and, on the old carpet lying down, your head resting among your charitable knees in your pale robe, O calm child, I will speak to you for hours; there are no more fields and the streets are empty, I will speak to you of our furniture.. You are distracted?

(Those spiderwebs shiver at the top of the tall windows.)
