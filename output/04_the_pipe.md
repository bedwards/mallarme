# The Pipe

Yesterday, I found my pipe while dreaming of a long evening of work, of fine winter work. Cigarettes thrown away with all the childish joys of summer in the past lit up by blue leaves of sun, the muslins, and my grave pipe taken up again by a serious man who wants to smoke at length without being disturbed, the better to work: but I was not expecting the surprise that this forsaken thing was preparing — scarcely had I drawn the first puff when I forgot the grand books I had to write, marveled, moved, I breathed the winter returning. I had not touched the faithful friend since my return to France, and all London, London as I lived it entirely for myself alone, appeared a year ago: first the dear fogs that muffle our brains and have, over there, a smell of their own, when they creep in under the window. My tobacco smelled of a dark room with leather furniture dusted with coal dust on which the thin black cat would roll; the great fires! and the maid with red arms pouring coal on the coals, and the noise of those coals falling from the sheet-iron bucket into the iron basket, in the morning — when the postman struck the solemn double knock, which brought me back to life! I saw again through the window those sickly trees of the deserted square — I saw the open sea, so often crossed that winter, shivering on the deck of the steamer wet with drizzle and blackened with smoke — with my poor beloved wandering, in traveling clothes, a long dress the dull color of road dust, a coat that clung damp to her cold shoulders, one of those straw hats without plume and almost without ribbons that rich ladies throw away on arriving, so tattered are they by the sea air, and that poor beloveds refurbish for many a season more. Around her neck was wound the terrible handkerchief one waves when saying goodbye forever.
