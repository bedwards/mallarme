# The Demon of Analogy

Have you ever had unknown words singing on your lips — the cursed shreds of an absurd phrase?

I left my apartment with the clean sensation of a wing gliding across the strings of an instrument, dragging and light, which a voice replaced, pronouncing the words on a descending tone: "The Penultimate is dead," so that

*The Penultimate*

ended the line and

*Is dead*

detached itself from the fateful suspension more uselessly still into the void of meaning. I took steps in the street and recognized in the sound *nul* the taut string of the musical instrument, which was forgotten and which the glorious Memory had certainly just visited with its wing or a palm, and, my finger on the artifice of the mystery, I smiled and implored with intellectual vows a different speculation. The phrase came back, virtual, released from an earlier fall of feather or branch, henceforth heard through the voice until at last it articulated itself alone, living with its own personality. I went along (no longer content with mere perception) reading it as an end of verse and, once, as a trial, adapting it to my speech; soon pronouncing it with a silence after "Penultimate," in which I found a painful pleasure: "The Penultimate —" then the string of the instrument, so taut in forgetfulness on the sound *nul*, broke no doubt, and I added by way of prayer: "Is dead." I did not stop trying to return to thoughts I preferred, alleging, to calm myself, that *penultimate* is surely a term from the lexicon meaning the next-to-last syllable of a word, and that its apparition, the rest badly abjured from a labor of linguistics by which daily there sobs the interruption of my noble poetic faculty: the sonority itself and the air of falsehood assumed by the haste of the easy affirmation were a cause of torment. Harassed, I resolved to let the words of this sad nature wander of themselves across my mouth, and I went murmuring with the intonation susceptible of condolence: "The Penultimate is dead, she is dead, quite dead, the despairing Penultimate," believing thereby to satisfy the anxiety, and not without the secret hope of burying it in the amplification of the psalmody when, horror! — by a magic easily deductible and nervous — I felt that I had, my hand reflected by a shopfront window, made the gesture of a caress that descends upon something, the voice itself (the first, which had indubitably been the only one).

But where the irrecusable intervention of the supernatural installs itself, and the beginning of the anguish under which my spirit — lately sovereign — agonizes, is when I saw, raising my eyes, in the street of the antique dealers, that I had instinctively followed and was standing before the shop of a luthier, seller of old instruments hung on the wall, and, on the ground, yellow palms and the wings, buried in shadow, of ancient birds. I fled, bizarre, a person condemned probably to wear the mourning of the inexplicable Penultimate.
