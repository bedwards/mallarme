# Reminiscence

Orphan, I wandered in black, my eye vacant of family; at a crossroads the tents of a fair were unfolding — I sensed the future and that I would be thus, I loved the smell of vagabonds, toward them to forget my comrades. No chorus cry of tearing, nor long tirade, the drama requesting the holy hour of the footlights — I wished to speak with a kid too unsteady to figure among his race, in a nightcap cut like Dante's hood; who was withdrawing into himself, under the aspect of a slice of soft cheese, already the snow of summits, the lily or other constitutive whiteness of wings within: I would have begged him to admit me to his superior meal, shared quickly with some famous elder against a nearby canvas during feats of strength and banalities fit for daylight. Naked, pirouetting in his leotard nimbleness, to my surprise it was he who began the conversation: "Your parents?" — "I haven't any." — "Come now, if you only knew how funny it is, a father.. even last week when he refused his soup, he made faces just as beautiful as when the master was throwing slaps and kicks around. My dear!" and to triumph by raising his leg at me with glorious ease, "he wows us, papa," then to bite with chaste relish at the very young one's treat: "Your mama, you haven't got one either, maybe? you're alone? mine eats tow and the world claps hands. You don't know anything, parents are funny people who make you laugh." The parade was rising to a pitch, he left: I would sigh, me, disappointed suddenly at not having parents.
