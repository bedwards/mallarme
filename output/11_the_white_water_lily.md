# The White Water Lily

I had been rowing for a long time, with a clean sweeping gesture, drowsy, my eyes fixed inward on the complete forgetting of going, as the laughter of the hour flowed round about. So much immobility lazed that grazed by an inert sound where the yawl slipped to half its length, I did not verify the stop until the steady glinting of initials on the bared oars recalled me to my worldly identity.

What was happening, where was I?

I had, to see clearly into the adventure, to recall my departure early, that July of flame, on the lively interval between its sleeping vegetations of an always narrow and distracted stream, in quest of water-blossomings and with the design of recognizing the site occupied by the property of a friend's friend, to whom I was to improvise a greeting. Without any ribbon of grass detaining me before one landscape more than another, chased with its reflection in the water by the same impartial stroke of oar, I had just run aground in some tuft of reeds, mysterious end of my course, in the middle of the river: where at once widened into a fluvial grove, it spreads a nonchalant pond pleated with hesitations from a source.

The detailed inspection taught me that this obstacle of greenery tapering into the current masked the single arch of a bridge, prolonged to land, here and there, by a hedge enclosing lawns. I understood. Simply the park of Madame.., the unknown to be greeted.

A fine vicinity, during the season, the nature of the person who had chosen a retreat as humid and impenetrable could only be conformable to my taste. Sure of it, she had made of this crystal her interior mirror, sheltered from the indiscretion glaring in the afternoons; she came there and the silver mist icing the willows was soon nothing but the limpidity of her gaze accustomed to each leaf.

Entirely I evoked her lustral.

Bent in the sporting attitude that kept me in curiosity, as under the spacious silence of what was announcing itself the stranger, I smiled at the beginning of servitude released by a feminine possibility: that the straps attaching the rower's shoe to the boat's planking were not without meaning, as one does not become one with the instrument of one's sorcery.

— "Just as well then, any woman at all.." I was about to finish.

When an imperceptible sound made me wonder whether the inhabitant of the bank was haunting my leisure, or unexpectedly the pool.

The step ceased, why?

Subtle secret of feet that come, that go, leading the spirit where the dear shadow wills — buried in cambric and the lace of a skirt flooding the ground as if to circumvent from heel to toe, in a flotation, that initiative by which the walk opens, all the way down, and the folds cast back into a train, an escape, of its knowing double arrow.

Does the stroller herself know a reason for her station: and is it not, for me, too tender to raise my head above these rushes and all the mental drowsiness where my lucidity veils itself, to question the mystery as far as that!

— "To what type your features conform themselves, I sense their precision, Madame, interrupted here by the rustling of an arrival, yes! this instinctive charm from below that does not defend against the most authentically tied explorer, with a diamond buckle, belts. So vague a concept suffices; and does not transgress the delight stamped with generality that permits and commands the exclusion of all faces, to the point that the revelation of one (do not lean to peer, confirmed, on the furtive threshold where I reign) would chase away my trouble, with which it has nothing to do."

My presentation, in this garb of aquatic marauder, I can risk it, with the excuse of chance.

Separated, we are together: I slip into her confused intimacy, in this suspense on the water where my reverie delays the indecisive one, better than a visit, followed by others, will authorize. How many idle speeches in comparison with the one I held in order not to be heard, it will be necessary, before finding once more as intuitive an accord as now, the hearing level with the mahogany toward the sand entire that has fallen silent!

The pause measures itself to the time of her determination.

Advise, O my dream, what to do.

To sum up in a glance the virgin absence scattered in this solitude and, as one gathers, in memory of a site, one of those magical water lilies enclosed there that suddenly surface, enveloping in their hollow whiteness a nothing, made of intact dreams, of the happiness that will not take place and of my breath held here in the fear of an apparition, to leave with: tacitly, unmooring little by little, without the collision breaking the illusion nor the lapping of the visible bubble of foam curled at my flight casting at the feet of anyone the transparent resemblance of the theft of my ideal flower.

If, attracted by a feeling of the unusual, she has appeared, the Meditative or the Haughty, the Fierce, the Gay — too bad for that unspeakable expression I shall never know! for I accomplished according to the rules the maneuver: freeing myself, I turned and was already rounding a bend in the stream, carrying away like a noble swan's egg, such that no flight will spring from it, my imaginary trophy, which swells with nothing other than the exquisite vacancy of self that one loves, in summer, to pursue, in the alleys of her park, every lady, pausing sometimes and at length, as at the brink of a spring or some body of water.
