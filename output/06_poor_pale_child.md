# Poor Pale Child

Poor pale child, why scream your shrill and insolent song at the top of your lungs in the street, where it is lost among the cats, lords of the rooftops? for it will not pass through the shutters of the first floors, behind which you do not know there hang heavy curtains of incarnadine silk.

Yet you sing fatally, with the tenacious assurance of a little man who goes off alone through life, counting on no one, working for himself. Have you never had a father? You haven't even an old woman to make you forget hunger by beating you, when you come home without a sou.

But you work for your keep: standing in the streets, covered in faded clothes cut for a grown man, a thinness premature and too great for your age, you sing to eat, fiercely, without lowering your mean eyes toward the other children playing on the pavement.

And your lament is so high, so high, that your bare head rising in the air as your voice climbs seems to want to leave your small shoulders.

Little man, who knows whether it will not go away one day, when, after having cried a long time in the cities, you will have committed a crime? a crime is not so hard; come, it is enough to have courage after the desire, and such as who.. Your little figure is energetic.

Not a sou falls into the wicker basket your long hand holds dangling without hope against your trousers: they will make you wicked and one day you will commit a crime.

Your head keeps straining upward and wants to leave you, as if it knew in advance, while you sing a tune that is becoming menacing.

It will bid you farewell when you pay for me, for those worth less than me. You probably came into the world for this and you have been fasting from the start; soon now, we will see you in the newspapers.

Oh! poor little head!
